          Amy Winehouse (1983â€“2011) was a British singer-songwriter renowned for
          her deeply emotive voice and her genre-blending music that drew from
          jazz, soul, and R&B.

          Born on September 14, 1983, in Southgate, London, she grew up in a
          family with strong musical influences, particularly her father's love
          for jazz. Winehouse achieved international fame with her second album,
          Back to Black (2006), which won her five Grammy Awards, including
          Record of the Year for the hit single "Rehab." The album,
          characterized by its raw lyrics and retro production, became one of
          the best-selling records of the 21st century and established her as
          one of the defining artists of her generation.

          Known for her distinctive style, which included her iconic beehive
          hairstyle and winged eyeliner, Winehouse's life was marked by both
          creative brilliance and personal struggles. Her battles with addiction
          and the intense media scrutiny surrounding her private life
          overshadowed much of her career.
